# XboxControllerRemote

The goal of this project is to write a program that lets you use your Xbox controller as a remote
control when browsing Netflix, providing a similar experience to browsing Netflix on a game
console. Depending on how things go, this project may be specialized to Netflix, or it may become
a general mouse/keyboard emulator using an Xbox controller.
